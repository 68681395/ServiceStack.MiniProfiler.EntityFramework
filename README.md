This project exists to allow profiling EntityFramework with the MiniProfiler version included in ServiceStack.

To use, reference ServiceStack.MiniProfiler.EntityFramework, then follow the instructions from the original MiniProfiler project.

There has not been made a NuGet package for this yet (could easily be added)
